# Game Master AI Agent (WIP) 🎲🤖

This project and REAME.md is still a work in progress and some things may change in the future. 

## Overview
Game Master AI Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help tabletop RPG Game Masters (GMs) with various tasks, making session management smoother and more immersive. Built using [Hugging Face's smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index), this agent provides a set of tools to enhance campaign planning, gameplay, and world-building.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)
- 🎲 **Multi Dice Roller** – Roll any combination of dice with modifiers and custom rules.
- 🏰 **NPC Character Generator** – Instantly create unique NPCs with names, backgrounds, and personality traits.
- 💡 **Idea & Campaign Planning** – Generate creative story hooks, plot twists, and campaign arcs.
- 🎵 **Music Playlist Generator** – Curate background music playlists based on mood and setting.
- 📖 **Knowledge Base** – Store and retrieve campaign-specific lore, player decisions, and world details.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** [Hugging Face SmolAgents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index)
- **Language:** Python
- **APIs & Libraries:** OpenAI API (for text generation), NLTK/Spacy (for NLP), Flask (for UI/API interactions)
